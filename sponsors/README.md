Hi, I'm Chlod Aidan Alejandro, a student and software developer from the Philippines! You may know me from a few things: [my Wikipedia contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Chlod), Wikimedia tools and userscripts I work on: [RedWarn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RedWarn), [Ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ultraviolet), and [Deputy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deputy), my work on archiving and processing [PAGASA](https://github.com/pagasa-parser/pagasa-parser) and [JTWC](https://wiki.chlod.net/jtwc) tropical cyclone advisories, or through the [Ralsei Bot](https://ralsei.chlod.net/) on Discord. A lot of my work consists of open source development â€” and that's a good thing! I love developing open source projects, and I am to release all my works to the public for their own education or benefit.

All of the tools I develop, be it for your own computer or for tools on [my website](https://chlod.net/) are provided free of charge. In most cases, I even give out the source code for my work. That said, all these tools don't come for free. Ralsei Bot and the [PAGASA Parser](https://pagasa.chlod.net/) are both hosted on my personal server, which costs ~$90 yearly. Exactly because of this, the performance of these are correlated to how much performance I can squeeze out of a cheap VPS. Most of my current income comes from allowances from my family, and as a current college student, I'm not able to split myself apart and go part-time.

Nevertheless, I still plan on doing many more great projects in the future, but a little help would definitely be appreciated. By supporting me, you can help me in maintaining the upkeep of the servers I use to host my tools, and you can enable me to spend more on server costs to improve the performance of my tools. In addition, I'll be able to use some of the surplus funds to fund my own personal projects that involve physical components (microcontrollers and the like) besides the components I'll purchase for my college degree. All (monthly) tiers stack on the benefits of previous tiers, and being a part of any tier means I will give you the highest priority when it comes to conversations anywhere on the internet or in real life.

I know there's not much incentive for you to support as of now: and that's perfectly valid. You can support at your own discretion. My goal is to keep on making things to churn out something that you can eventually be compelled to support. If you can't support or don't have the money, that's okay too! Most of my projects will still be free to use, and will always be. This is not a required payment for my services, but as a donation to honor what I do online.

Until next time!
