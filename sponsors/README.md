👋 Hello! I'm Chlod Aidan Alejandro, a college student and open-source software developer from the Philippines. 🇵🇭

I've been writing code for the open source community for a few years now. Most of this work is done in my free time and as a volunteer; I juggle development work which I'm very passionate about with studying for my undergraduate degree in Information Technology at [Mapúa University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapúa_University).

You might know me from a few projects, like:
* 🤠 [Ultraviolet](https://gitlab.wikimedia.org/repos/10nm/ultraviolet) - a user-friendly Wikipedia counter-vandalism tool and the successor to [RedWarn](https://gitlab.wikimedia.org/repos/10nm/redwarn-web). Its source is available on GitLab.
* 🌀 [PAGASA Parser](https://pagasa.chlod.net) - a library that parses information from [PAGASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAGASA)'s Tropical Cyclone Bulletin page and turns it into various formats.
* 🏛️ [JTWC Archiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chlod/Tools/JTWC_Archiver) - an automatic archive of all Joint Typhoon Warning Center warnings and products.
* 🔍 [Deputy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deputy) - a copyright investigation suite for Wikipedia.
* ⏩ [wikimedia-streams](https://github.com/ChlodAlejandro/wikimedia-streams) - a library for receiving data streams from Wikimedia.
* 🪄 [Tech Contribs](https://techcontribs.toolforge.org/) - a tool that shows technical contributions for developers in the Wikimedia movement.

I've also made contributions to the 🌻 [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki) core and extensions, 🦄 [Wikimedia Toolforge](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Toolforge) projects, and a lot of other software within the Wikimedia movement. I'm also part of 🚀 [Google Developer Student Clubs – Mapúa Manila](https://github.com/gdsc-mapua); . There's a lot more that I've done; you can check out my [portfolio](https://chlod.net/portfolio) if you want to see more.

I love developing open source projects, and I strive to keep my code public and free for everyone to use or reference. Since I'm currently in college though, I'm not able to split myself into two to get a part-time job nor do I have a lot of money to spend on server costs and other expenses that come with maintaining these projects.

A little help here on GitHub Sponsors goes a long way in making sure that most of my projects stay public for free, for everyone, forever. You can help in maintaining the upkeep of the servers I use, and you can allow me to spend more on infrastructure and equipment for enhancing my tools. It'll also allow me to spend more of my personal savings for getting through college, which itself is what I spend most of my money on.

All (monthly) tiers stack on the benefits of previous tiers, and being a part of any tier means I will give you the higher priority when it comes to conversations anywhere on the internet or in real life. Any amount is appreciated, and I'm grateful for your support.

I know there's not much incentive for you to support as of now: and that's perfectly valid. You can support at your own discretion. My goal is to keep on making things to churn out something that you can eventually be compelled to support. If you can't support or don't have the money, that's okay too! Most of my projects will still be free to use, and will always be. This is not a required payment for my services, but as a donation to honor what I do online.

Until next time!
