## Hello! ‚ú®

My name is Chlod Aidan Alejandro, and I'm an open-source software developer and college student based in the Philippines. You can call me whatever you want, be it "Chlod", "Aidan", „Äå„Ç¢„Ç§„ÉÄ„É≥Âêõ„Äç, or just "dude".

### üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...
A lot of things, [much of which](https://chlod.net/projects) are documented on my website. Although you might know me from a few of my projects:
* [Ralsei Bot](https://ralsei.chlod.net) - a Discord bot themed around Ralsei, a character from the game DELTARUNE. The source is private, but I do have the source on GitHub.
* [Ultraviolet](https://gitlab.com/redwarn/ultraviolet) - a user-friendly Wikipedia counter-vandalism tool and the successor to [RedWarn](https://gitlab.com/redwarn/redwarn-web). Its source is available on GitLab.
* [PAGASA Parser](https://pagasa.chlod.net) - a library that parses information from [PAGASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAGASA)'s Tropical Cyclone Bulletin page and turns it into various formats.
* [JTWC Archiver](https://wiki.chlod.net/jtwc) - an automatic archive of all Joint Typhoon Warning Center warnings and products.
* [Zoomiebot](https://zoomiebot.toolforge.org) - a bot for Wikipedia.
* [Deputy](https://github.com/ChlodAlejandro/deputy) - a copyright investigation suite for Wikipedia.
* [wikimedia-streams](https://github.com/ChlodAlejandro/wikimedia-streams) - a library for receiving data streams from Wikimedia.

### üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
Information Technology at [Map√∫a University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map√∫a_University). *Not* literally, I'm currently sticking to TypeScript as my language of choice, and I'm not focusing on any other language for the time being. I do wish to learn Rust at some point.

### üí¨ Ask me about ...
Anything under the sun. If you have some code issues that I can probably solve within 10 minutes, don't be afraid to ask. If you need anime recommendations or Japanese language learning resources, I'll be happy to give you some. If you want me to tell you how to learn a language... well that's pushing the boundaries a bit. Maybe if you [sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/ChlodAlejandro)? üòâ
